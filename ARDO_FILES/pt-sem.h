/**
 * \defgroup ptsem Protothread semaphores
 * @{
 *
 * This module implements counting semaphores on top of
 * protothreads. Semaphores are a synchronization primitive that
 * provide two operations: "wait" and "signal". The "wait" operation
 * checks the semaphore counter and blocks the thread if the counter
 * is zero. The "signal" operation increases the semaphore counter but
 * does not block. If another thread has blocked waiting for the
 * semaphore that is signalled, the blocked thread will become
 * runnable again.
 *
 * Semaphores can be used to implement other, more structured,
 * synchronization primitives such as monitors and message
 * queues/bounded buffers (see below).
 *
 * The following example shows how the producer-consumer problem, also
 * known as the bounded buffer problem, can be solved using
 * protothreads and semaphores. Notes on the program follow after the
 * example.

 *
 * The program uses three protothreads: one protothread that
 * implements the consumer, one thread that implements the producer,
 * and one protothread that drives the two other protothreads. The
 * program uses three semaphores: "full", "empty" and "mutex". The
 * "mutex" semaphore is used to provide mutual exclusion for the
 * buffer, the "empty" semaphore is used to block the consumer is the
 * buffer is empty, and the "full" semaphore is used to block the
 * producer is the buffer is full.
 *
 * The "driver_thread" holds two protothread state variables,
 * "pt_producer" and "pt_consumer". It is important to note that both
 * these variables are declared as <i>static</i>. If the static
 * keyword is not used, both variables are stored on the stack. Since
 * protothreads do not store the stack, these variables may be
 * overwritten during a protothread wait operation. Similarly, both
 * the "consumer" and "producer" protothreads declare their local
 * variables as static, to avoid them being stored on the stack.
